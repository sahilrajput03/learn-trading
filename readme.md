WHAT POSSIBLE WAYS TO GET MONEY FOR TRADING?
- invest your own money or someone's money
- companies hire good traders with good history

WHAT IS STOCK?
 It is a security that signifies ownership in a coporation. So having a stock will have you claim on that company's assets and earnings.

PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COMPANY?
A private company has a relatively small amount of owners and it doesn't trade on public exchange.
A public company is a big company that trades on public exchanges, e.g., apple, amazon, netflix, etc.

- There is process to move from a private company to a public company.

In private company, to be able to buy shares in a private company you got to konw the owner or someboy works there or you got to be a qualified investor. And its difficult for private companies to get funding when they really need it coz they have a small pool for investment source. Its hard to buy shares in private companies.

In public companies, anybody can invest in them, you don't need to know the owner or sombody in the company. You just need to contact the bank or the broker and ask them and its done. Its extremely easy to buy shares in public companies.


MARKET - vid4
Clothing, electornic, grocery markets?
Types of market:
- regular: bargaining is not allowed
- auction market: buyers can compete on the bids that they are willing to pay for the product AND sellers cna compete on the offers that they're willing to sell that product for.

STOCK MARKET is an auction market, i.e, there are no set prices. Buyers are bidding for the best price that they are willing to pay for that stock for that product. And sellers are offereing they are offering how much they're willing to sell their stock. AND its all going simultaneously and continuously throught the trading day. And thats how prices are set.

Now,
- primary market: a market that stocks trade in for the first time. So the first time the stock is issued and goes to market, thats a primary market.
- secondary market: It the same market that trades every other market after first time. Every time the stock has been traded second hand somebody already owner it before you, you're in the seondary market.

Going from private to public company: You need to have to do an IPO which is what we call `Initial Public Offering`. It means that you're going to sell the stocks for your company to the public for the first time.
HOW do you do an IPO?
You're going to hire another company which is going to be called underwriting firm. So underwriting firms basically specialize in doing IPOs. So this underwriting firm gonna comeover and see your revenues, debts, product sells for that price and everything and say agrees on that "we can get you 100,000,000$ i.e., they're going to figure out whats the best price that they can sell your stocks in the beginning for them to be able to sell you the amount of shares that you want to sell. And obviously that company is going to want to give you the best amount of money that you can come up with without asking for too much because if they ask for too much and your IPO fails you're not able to get that money then they're gonna have a really bad reputation. So for them they want to get you the most money. At the same time they want to be able to sell all the shares so they maintain their reputation. So its very importatnt for them to come up with an exact price and exact amount of money that they can come up with for you.

__ So let say in our case they might say OK well we think we can raise you 100M$. Again  say we're going to sell a million shares @ 100$ each, i.e., we're going to IPO at a price of 100$ and sell million shares so you get your 100M$.

So, once they decide to sell those million shares that's going to happen in primary market. So this underwriting firm is going to call all the relationships say the brokers, the banks, the big insurance companies they know and have relationships with and say look I have this new company its called DNT and they make really cool drones. I have some shares I can give you, a hundred thousand shares, do you want some? I'll allocate you some shares for that IPO and they're going to sell those shares to other relationships and that's going to be the first time that the shares are sold which is going to be in the primary market. So those companies the brokers everybody who gets shares can give some of those shares to their biggest clients. So if you are a very big cilent and a big brokerage firm you might get some shares of that company.
Example: When snapchat or facebook went public and they went public. We rarely get shares in primary market bcoz its so hard you've got to be somebody very big to get shares in the primary market. Now after those shares are sold in the primary market then there is a date where the stock starts trading on the exchange which were going to come to in the next module. But when these shares start trading and in that exchange they start trading in the secondary market. So whenever you or I buy something on Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, that's all the second hand, these stocks were already sold, they were already IPO'd, they're in the secondary market now. We're selling them and buying them from other people who had them were not the first people to get them ever.
So, we're always going to talking abt secondary market when we're buying and selling securities bcoz we're not the first people to get them.

WHAT IS AN EXCHANGE? - vid5
A market is a general term that relates to where stocks are trading. NOW when we're talking about exchanges we're actually talking about the exact location where the trades are being executed, so New York Stock Exchange is an exchange, its a location that you can go to buy and sell stocks. Nasdaq is another location where you can go and buy stocks. The stock market but they are different exchanges.
How stock exchanges were born?
Initially in 1800's when you wanted to buy or sell a stock if you would have to find somebody who wanted to buy or sell the same stock from you at the exact prices that you were willing to buy or sell it at. Redwood agreement by a group of money savy people that all other people would have to pay for a quater or 1 percent of the stocks they are buying/selling from this group so it becomes a way earn via this agreement and after a year they bought a building which is now known as The New York Stock Exchange. So thats how the New York Stock Exchange was born and these 24 people were the original brokers.
A broker is a person to whom you need to go to, to buy/sell your securities with another broker. Today there's three main exchanges that exists: The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and there's Amex. NYSE is the biggest and most demanding exchange. An exchange is like a store, and to have your product in a store, the store has to accept having it. A stock exchnage looks for the criteria of the companies when the companies asks to list them on their exchanges like: it needs to be big company, you got to be having a minimum number of employees, your price has to be over a certian price. Your stock has to trade a certain amount of times every day.
Second exchange is Nasdaq, its less demanding is very known for having tech companies. So most tech companies are on Nasdaq exchange. Different stocks trade on different exchanges they don't trade on all the exchanges. You can buy different companies at different exchanges. Some companies very rarely are interlisted on more than one exchange but mostly they are going to be one exchange.
Third exchange is AMEX, its an exchange that caters to ETFs - Exchange Traded Funds. Most ETFs are going to be on AMEX exchange.
SO THOSE ARE THREE EXCHANGES IN US, in different countries there would be different exchanges.

--
Brokers hire floor brokers and delegate them the work of buy/sell stocks.

So with the automation with computers, there is no longer need of broker's signing the deal or need to find the partner broker to have a deal with coz computers match the deal automatically with the mathcing price to get the desired seller/buyer for the same price automatically. BUT IT still goes though your broker and it matches right away. But you still got to give them commision to route your order and do the othe paperwork.

2. Orders and Prices
====================


1. THE TICKER - An abbrevation for the name of the company. E.g., MFST is ticker for microsoft, Citigroups ticker is just the letter C
2. SIDE OF THE ORDER - Buy order (you wanna buy) or sell order (you wanna sell)
3. TYPE OF ORDER - **Two most basic orders for now-**
- a.) Market order - immediately no matter what the price it's at, when you just want the execution. You don't need to give your broker a price.
- b.) Limit order - When you tell the broker that you want at a limit price or better. You need to give a price for the order at which you wanna sell/buy at.

RULES:
- You choose market order when its time sensitive but its not price sensitive. BAD: You may get it at bad price.
- If you care about price but you don't care about waiting for the stock to reach that price then, then you do a limit order. BAD: You might miss the opportunity

4. QUANTITY: It is the number of shares you want to buy/sell, say 200 share or 300 shares.
5. PRICE

--- 
VID: 2nd video of ``orders and prices``

News/events do not move prices but the orders people sends does move the prices.

SHARES OUTSTANDING: Its the amount of shares you company has issued, e.g., 100,000 shares.
FLOAT: It is the amount of shares that are currently trading on the market. So, its quite possible that (Share Outstanding != Float) bcoz a company might be holding some of its shares for itself or some of its shares might be locked up somewhere that they're not trading. So the shares that trade on the market right now is what we cal the foat. E.g, you have 75,000 shares float (that means 25000 shares are locked by company / some private investors that are not available on the market at this time.



--
There's a price priority for the buyers in the algorithm of exchange system, so higher you're willing to buy the higher you'r priority of matching will be and it'll be vice-versa for the case if you are seller i.e., the lower you're willing to sell at the better your priority will be.
BUT if two person have the same price set for buy/sell order then the person who came first will have higher priority.

Level 2 / Book:  Its actually a large book representing every single buyer and seller out there in the market.

Level 1 is the best prices at which someone is willing to buy (BID) (b=b, buyer=bidder) and sell (OFFER) at. This is created from Level 2's top priority sell and buy list. Level 1 gets updated everytime the best bid or best offer changes.
E.g, looks like:
- 1. Best price of current sellers with the amount of shares
- 2. Best price of current buyers with the amount of shares
- 3. Last execution details at which the execution happened
So, Level 1 is abbreviated quotation system of the book (level 2) and TOS (Time of Sales).
So, by looking at te Level 1 you can have a general idea of the market i.e., whats the bet, whats the ask, whats the quantity on the bid or the ask its been traded at.

Time Of Sales(TOS): It is a continuos update something that the exchange has to report on at every execution that happens and on it it puts the name of stock you are trading, the time the trade happened at, the quantity and the price it happened at.

FORGOTTEN TERMONOGILES OF SAHIL: Order is open (when a partial trade is happened), Trade executed (when a trade is completed).

CONDITION: Say if `Level 1` is to have like buyer has higher price than the seller is willing to sell for, then the buyer just buy at the selling price only so that means buyer don't spend extra bucks though.

An trade request gets `partial fill` if the best seller doesn't not have sufficient shares to sell to him and the remaining shares would be kept `open` in the book and will wait for future potential matching buyers.

SO IN THE END OF DATE, prices fell down and step up bcoz of supply and demand of buyers and sellers.

QUITE POSSIBLE: So its quite possible that some good news has come for the company but still the price fell down so the actual reason could be that someone sent a big sell order thus any low priced bid would be executed directly.

TERMINOLOGIES:
BID is the best price you can buy at from Level 1
ASK is the best price you can sell at from Level 1
SPREAD is the difference between the big and the ask

Spread is something important, you loose spread, spread is the loss if you make a market order buy it and then sell it instantly thus making a loss of `spread`.
NOTE: When you trade you can see the spread for the stocks, thus you would mostly see bigger companies have smaller spread and smaller/liquid companies have comparatively bigger spreads.

NBBO: National Best Bid and Offer: It is basically the best bid and best offer available.

=> Diff b/w Level 1 and NBBO ?
FOR NOW they are same thing.

vlc 3.\ Different\ Players.mp4

tumble: fall suddenly, clumsily, or headlong

Some big companies/clients of shareholders might sell when some good news come out just to sell quickly thus it makes sense that price drop occurs on a good news event as well.

You should always be knowing who you are trading against bcoz day trading is a zero sum game i.e., when you get some money its coming from someone else's pocket. Other big players in the day trading study other players as well just so they can trade better. Do they bluff a lot, how do they call? So they can have every advantage they can have.

For every trade that you're going to trade you want to konw what is the institutional ownership on that stock. Is there lot of institutions that own that stock? Like fb has 70% or higher or does it or does it have no institutional ownership, so its all retail floats, all retail people who are buying it. And stategies work differently for the stocks taht have high institutional and stocks that have low instituions. Retails gonna just buying on good news, they're not gonna offload on good news.

First you have proprietary trading firms, which is like us, now proprietary trading firms are smart. They're considered smart money they konw what they're doing, so they are trying to take advantage of small inefficiencies in the market and get in and get out quickly. So these guys have a lot of tools and information and access and commissions and fees. So they are very competitive.

Another type of players are investors. Now investors they just come in and buy stocks and they keep them for a while. So they're not trading, they'r eputting money and leaving it for a longer period.
You have your retail traders, retail traders are traders who trade from home who don't have a lot of sophisticated tools or information or strategies. Now for these people that's considered dumb money becoz its easy money to make. So as a trader or as a professional trader somebody who does this in a smart manner, you want stocks taht have a lot of retail flow becoz again you're getting money from somebody so you want to play against people who aren't as smart as you. Portfolio Manager which are mutual funds. So theses are big funds. A mutual fund is a big fund that people put money in and has a portfolio manager the portfolio manager oversees those funds and buys and sells stocks with those funds. So it could be hundred of millions of dollars following a prospectus that the clients agreed on. So you konw he might say I'm putting 20% in financial stocks 20% in gold stocks and he's  going to fall back and but he's going to pick and choose the stocks that he thinks will make you the most money. Mutual funds haven't been performing very well in the past. They actually perform worse than ETF. And we'll cover ETF in more detail in another module. But if you just put money in the markets you'll actually outperform mutual funds and the reason for that is becoz in mutual funds the portfolio managers takes a manager expense ratio so he takes a fee every year about 2%. And this kind of adds up it takes away from the money you get and he doesn't actually do well enought to beat the market. So mutual funds aren't really good to put money in. You're better off taking the time to selet your stocks even if you're an investor. But it is one of the big players becoz mutual funds are going to buy a lot of shares in a company and when they sell they sell lot of shares so you're going to have to know about that and you can know which mutual fund has which stocks in their holdings. And you can know they're going to trade those stocks just by konwing that they have it bcoz it is known that when mututla funds have a stock that's been performing very well, they're going to try and remove money from that stock to take some moeny off the table, take some profits and put it in somethng that's still undervalues and that not overvalues anymore. So we can guess what other players are goin to do. And by guessing what other players are going to do we can guess what the stock is going to do. Because at the end day you're not trying to guess where the stock is going to go. You're trying to guess what other people are going to do becoz what other are going to do is whats going to drive the stock to go in that or this direction. So don't try to predict "Is that a good company is this stock not a good company." What you want to do is try to predict how are other people evaluating that stock? Becoz of that evaluation that's what's going ot drive their orders and thus changing the state of market.
Other type of player is hedge funds, they are very smart money they're like mututalfunds, big capital, not anybody can put money in a hedge fund. So you have to be somebody who's rich enough becoz there's very strict miniums and hedge funds can do more than mutual funds so they can go long or go short which we're going to cover. And another module will go in for this. Hedge funds are way more sophisticated than mutual funds, they're smarter, they tend to make more returns and they're very very discrete. So we can't really know what positions they have up until several months after so when its too late but these are top players. And for every stock that you're going to trade from now and every strategy you're going to look at institutional ownership and base your strategy on that.

THREE STRATEGIES TO MAKE MOENY IN STOCKS:
1. Going long a stock: It means you buy a stock and expect it go higher and sell it at a higher price and make profit. Thats the easiest way to make money. and if it goes down you're losing money.
2. Going short (less common): It means that you're betting that the stock is going to go down so you want to make money if the stock drops in value. It works by borrowing a stock i.e., you sell at higher price and thus when its price goes down you buy it back that how you make money by going short. Now who do you buy it from? You borrow it from your broker. (lend = udhaar) So you lend stock of a company for the broker. So you can short stocks. You cannot short shares in any account but in a margin account.

GOING SHORT: You can loose infinite money but make limited money. Its riskier. Good thing is that when stocks go down they go down at extremely fast but when they go up they go up slowly. So its always a good idea to short for a long time only.
GOING LONG: You can make infinite money but loose limited moeny.

Third way: Being flat means that having no positions: A lot new traders come in and they think they always have to be in market they always have to have a position to be ong, be short to be making money. But you can actually be making moeny but by not being in a position becoz if you're not in a good position you might lose money. So by not looing money you're making money. So being flat having no position you're avoiding the risk of loosing money.

Recommended Resources
========================

Interactive broker is the most highly recommended broker by far by me. ~Author

NSE: National Stock Exchange (India's exchagne on Interactive Brokers)

Simulation Trading available i.e., trade with fake money in interactive brokers.

They can be cheaper brokers which charge less comission fees but can have really bad execution experience.

Technical Analysis:
===================

chart patterns
moving averages
indicators

- Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis:
Both are useful in different circumstances.

- Fundamental Analysis: 
	Analysis based on:
	- how many emplyees they have
	- whats their tax system.
	- how is the political envionment
	- whats their revenue, their expenses, their debts
	- all of above things are fundamentals

In technical analysis:
	Analysis based on:
	- price and volume of how many shares are being traded

What to use when?
In you gonna hold for log term you'll need to do fundamental analysis.
If you are gonna do intraday trading you'll need to do technical analysis, all you care about is supply and demand right now. Day traders, swing traders love looking at technical analysis becoz we're short term traders. But its important to do lil bit of fundamental analysis as well coz sometimes news comes and you need to know how it would affect the stock based on fundamentals as well.

Tradingview.com - Trading charts used by good number of traders.


TRENDS
======
Trends are actually something that are at the core of technical analysis.
Prices moving trends and history repeats itself. Thats why we do technical analysis now.
Trend is just a new direction. And stocks can have uptrend, downtrend, sidetrend (i.e, towards right).
Uptrend: When we have higher lows and higher highs then we say we have a uptrend bcoz the movement is upwards.
ON the contrary if we have lower highs and lower lows then we say we have a downtrend.
ALSO, if the lows at the same price and the highs are at the same price so these types of movements then we have a side trend.

A stock cannot move in anyother trend other than uptrend, downtrend and sidetrend.

Trends don't stay forever but they last for a while.

We draw trend lines for support and resistance.

Do trends persists? i.e., price bounces off the support trend line but why?
"Becoz its been proven that trend persists. Its a self fulfilling prophecy."
